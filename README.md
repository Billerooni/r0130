# R-0130
_A game about staying charged._

R-0130 is a little game concept I had about a robot on a deserted planet mining for resources to stay alive, problem being that the planet isn't as lifeless as it seems.

## How to Play
`Mine` to get resources.

There's a 10% chance of getting coal and a 90% chance of getting dirt.

`Burn coal` to get 15% more power.

You can't mine with a full inventory.

Don't let your power fall to zero.
